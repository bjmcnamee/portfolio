#### This ML Multiclass project using python and sklearn modules trains and tests three classification models that predict the category of a given news article.
#### Process
  1. ETL ‚Äì 2000 text file documents were imported, filtered by html tag, and content features (headline, article and category) saved to related columns in a Pandas dataframe.
  2. Explore ‚Äì a statistical summary and plots shows the data is quite uniform (word count and document category count) with no missing or incomplete features.
  3. Pre-process ‚Äì in preparation for running ML models, the text was ‚Äòcleaned‚Äô again removing unwanted punctuation, digits, uppercase and stopwords
  4. Tokenise ‚Äì inflected words were reduced to smaller units called token by one of two functions, Stem and Lemmatise, eg caring ‚Üí car or caring ‚Üí care
  5. Vectorise ‚Äì the remaining words were converted to float numbers using a frequency‚Äìinverse document frequency TF-IDF method. 
  6. Model ‚Äì 3 multiclass classifcation models were selected
      1. K Nearest Neighbour (KNN)
      2. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
      3. Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB).
  7. Tune Model - Grid Search was applied to each model to discover the best hyperparameters and values.
  8. Model ‚Äì the data was split into training and test, and each of three models, trained and tested. Model accuracy was calculated including classification reports and confusion matrices.
  9. Model selection ‚Äì each model was run with various parameters fixed one at a time and the results written to file for compilation in order find the best model.

- Build Shiny app dashboard to display range of plots for any combination of variables of the Pharma Process Dataset
- Fit LR to plot
- Apply two Monte Carlo simulation models to predict variable tconc for variable year 2015
<br><br><i>Consider a machine that inserts a needle into test tubes on a conveyer for sampling in a factory process. This machine may become misaligned in the 2 dimensions of the plane of conveyer travel (x and y axes) independently. The machine is realigned to centre at the start of each day and it then samples 200 test tubes throughout the day. The machine fails to sample correctly if it is misaligned in any direction by 2cm or more, as it misses the test tube (possibly colliding with the glass). The x misalignment is 0.1mm on average in the direction of conveyor travel (positive x-direction) for each test, but that this can vary somewhat with a standard deviation of 0.1mm. Similarly, the y misalignment is biased in the negative y-direction, and is much smaller on average; the engineers believe that the average misalignment in the negative y direction is 0.05mm per test, with a standard deviation of 0.05mm.</i><br><br>
- Simulate the distribution of misalignments at the end of the day
- Estimate the likelihood of failure throughout the day? 
- Visualise the simulated alignments of the machine at the end of the day on a scatterplot, showing the 2cm limit
<br><br><i>It costs ‚Ç¨50,000 when the machine goes offline due to excessive misalignment and no further batches can be tested for the reminder of the day. Each batch passed through the machine results in gross profit of ‚Ç¨400. If a batch is ready for testing but the machine is offline, there is a ‚Ç¨500 cost for storage and alternate testing of each untested batch under the target number of tests per day.</i><br><br>
- Apply two Monte Carlo simulations to find the best strategy - i.e. what is the optimal target number of runs per day before realignment should be done.
